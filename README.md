# Flexporter
A Github backup for Flexporter

Main page: http://www.codercorner.com/Flexporter.htm

This is a backup of Flexporter-related code and binaries in case my old website goes down.

This is mainly a personal backup of old files, I do not expect this to still be useful for other people in 2023.
