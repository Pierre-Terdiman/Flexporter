 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Installation
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The NovodeX exporter has been implemented as a Flexporter plug-in.

 Please refer to the Flexporter package for a detailled documentation:

 www.codercorner.com/Flexporter.htm

 The "Novodexporter.flx" file should be treated as other "flx" files here.

 Please note the NovodeX plug-in only works with Flexporter 1.15 and above.
 This version has been included here for convenience, but it's an exclusive
 NovodeX release since last public version was 1.13b.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Usage
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Please refer to the Flexporter documentation.

 Joints
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To create joints between two bodies:
 - Link them so that one is a child of the other.
 - Select the child. The joint parameters are always defined on the child, since the child has a single parent.
 - In order to solve some internal MAX issues (mainly gimbal locks), make sure both pivots points (for the parent and
 for the child) are aligned with the object.
 - Go to the IK panel. We'll use IK parameters to derive joint data. The only panels we care about are the ones for
 "Sliding Joints" and "Rotational Joints".
 - Then, for each axis, the only parameters we care about are:
	- "Active" => tells if a DOF is active or not for this joint
	- "Limited" => tells if a DOF is limited or not
	- "From", "To" => limits if "Limited" is true.
 - The number of active DOFs determines the joint type:
	- Spherical: 3 rotational DOFs, 0 sliding DOFs
	- Prismatic: 0 rotational DOFs, 1 sliding DOFs
	- Hinge: 1 rotational DOFs, 0 sliding DOFs
	- Slider: 1 rotational DOFs, 1 sliding DOFs
	- PointOnLine: 3 rotational DOFs, 1 sliding DOFs
	- PointInPlane: 2 rotational DOFs, 0 sliding DOFs
	- CollisionVeto: 3 rotational DOFs, 3 sliding DOFs

 Bounding volumes
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 You can use implicit or explicit bounding volumes.

 Implicit bounding volumes are generated by the exporter. It can be a sphere, an AABB or an OBB. Please
 refer to next section to see how to choose between those.

 Explicit bounding volumes are created using MAX gizmo objects. Only Box Gizmos and Sphere Gizmos are supported.
 To link a Gizmo to an object, you have to group them together, in a MAX group. The exporter will automatically
 assign bounding volumes derived from Gizmo objects, to objects contained in the group.

 Note that if the group contains more than one object, the group is treated as a composite (compound) object,
 bounded by one or several bounding volumes.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 User-defined Properties
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We take advantage of User Properties in MAX, to define some physical parameters of a given mesh.

 To access them in MAX :
	- select the object
	- right click, select "Properties..." in the menu
	- select the "User Defined" property sheet

 Then define the parameter you want to setup, one of them each line.

 You can write them in different ways, for example:

	Parameter = <Value>

	or

	Parameter <Value>

 Here's the list of possible parameters:

	Mass <float>
		Defines the object's mass.

	Friction <float>
		Defines the object's friction.

	StaticFriction <float>
		Defines the object's static friction.

	Elasticity <float>
		Defines the object's elasticity

	Sphere
		Tells the engine to use a computer-generated bounding sphere, as the object's bounding volume.

	AABB
		Tells the engine to use a computer-generated AABB, as the object's bounding volume.

	OBB
		Tells the engine to use a computer-generated OBB, as the object's bounding volume.

	MESH
		Tells the engine to directly use the triangle mesh for collision detection and physics


 You can also define some global parameters at scene-level. To do that, use the Scene Description in MAX:
	- in the menu, select "File->Summary Info..."
	- use the Description box as the scene's User Properties.

 Available scene parameters :

	PhysStart <decimal>
		Setup start of simulation (number of seconds to wait before physics gets activated)

	PhysDuration <decimal>
		Setup duration of simulation (number of seconds to wait before going on to next scene)

	DragForce <decimal>
		Setup mouse drag force (applied on objects)

	CollisionDetection <decimal>
		0 => disable collision detection, else enable it

	GridRes <decimal>
		Setup resolution of grid

	Gravity <float> <float> <float>
		Setup gravity vector.

	GroundPlane <decimal>
		0 => disable default ground plane, else enable it

	StepSize <float>
		Setup simulation step size (most of the time you should rely on default value)


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Troubleshooting
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- Cameras are not exported so far.
	- Some joints are not correctly exported so far (PointInPlane...)
