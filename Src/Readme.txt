Flexporter Source Release - July, 29, 2005
------------------------------------------


This is a snapshot of Flexporter's source code made on July, 6, 2004
for a friend of mine (Pacôme Danhiez, www.ease-production.com).

One year later I haven't found the time to include his changes to the
main codebase, neither have I found the time to release a new Flexporter
version for MAX7 - or even MAX6.

But some people are still asking for updates nonetheless. For a long
time I hoped I could handle it and still support Flexporter for years.
Apparently I was wrong. So, instead, releasing the source code might
help people who are still using the plug-in in 2005.

The Flexporter code is fully included. However the source code for the
ICE dlls is not. You can still compile the plug though, since headers
and libs are provided. The ICE header files have slightly been edited,
to remove parts of commercial code I'm not supposed to distribute. It
is also one year old, but it doesn't matter much for Flexporter.

I probably won't update Flexporter anymore, but Pacôme's project looks
like a nice alternative. Of course you can also start your own exporter
using this source code.

Cheers,

- Pierre
